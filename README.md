# Diabetes-prediction
Diabetes mellitus (DM), commonly known as just diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by a high blood sugar level over a prolonged period of time.
Diabetes should not be ignored if it is untreated then Diabetes may cause some major issues in a person like: heart related problems, kidney problem, blood pressure, eye damage and it can also affect other organs of human body. Diabetes can be controlled if it is predicted earlier. 
To achieve early prediction of diabetes we are going to use some machine learning techniques in order to predict diabetes in a human body with a good accuracy. ML models used are Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier and by building a neural network.
Our model showed highest accuracy of 91.55 % in Random Forest Classifier.
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

The dataset used is Pima Indian Diabetes Database. The datasets consist of several medical predictor variables and one target variable Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
